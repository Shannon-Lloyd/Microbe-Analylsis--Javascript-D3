## About
Use the D3 library to connect to a url and read a json file. Use the D# library to access and update elements of a web page with data from the json file to create interactive elements on a web page.

## Getting Started
All necessary files are located in this belly-button-challenge repository. Data is retrieved from https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

The Static folder contains a JS folder contains the app.js file. App.js contains all the javasript code to create the interatcive visualizations for representing data about microbes that colonize human navels. This uses the D3 library to access and upadte elements on the index.html file in the main belly-button-challenge directory which is unaltered from the provided materias. The samples.json is for reference only. The images folder is for screenshots used in the README file.


## Installing
This was generated using Visual Studio 1.82.2  on a Windows 10 Pro system and Chrome 116.0.5845.188.


## Usage
Open the index.html file with Chromebook. The elements should auto populate with the first test subject's info for the test subject id showing in the drop down menu labeled "Test Subject ID No.:" select a different subject id from the menu to display the visual representations for the selected subject from the data provided by https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

This is how the output looks when the page is initially loaded:
